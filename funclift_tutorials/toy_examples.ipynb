    "## Why funclift\n",
    "\n",
    "funclift is a Python library that provides functors, applicatives, monads, profunctors, free monads and many other functional programming constructs for composing synchronous as well as asynchronous functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will use toy examples to walk you through the various features of funclift for the ease of learning. For practical usages of funclift, please refer to other examples in this git repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## function composition\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the details, it's helpful to point out that all these various constructs such as functors, applicatives and monads serve a common purpose: function composition. As you go through this tutorial, if you find yourself asking why a specific feature is useful, then the answer will mostly likely be related to the composition of certain types of functions.\n",

    "## pure functions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are pure and impure functions. Pure functions are like mathematical functions. They are total functions that always map the same input to the same output with no side effects. Here's an example of a pure function in Python:"

    "The function takes a boolean value as input. It's a total function because it's defined for all possible values of the `bool` type. If the input is True, it will always return 2. If the input is False, it will always return 3. So for the same input, it will always return the same output. Moreover, the function incurs no side effects such as performing network IO, mutating external states or throwing exceptions.\n",
